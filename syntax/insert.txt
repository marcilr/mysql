Insert


Two forms of insert statement:

The first way specifies both the column names and the values to be inserted:
  INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
  VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

If you are adding values for all the columns of the table, you do not need
to specify the column names in the SQL query.  However, make sure the order
of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table.  The INSERT
INTO syntax would be as follows:
  INSERT INTO table_name
  VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
