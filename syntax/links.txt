MySql Select, MANY FIELDS, how best to display in terminal?
Try enabling vertical mode, using \G to execute the query instead of ;:
  mysql> SELECT * FROM sometable \G
Your results will be listed in the vertical mode, so each column value
will be printed on a separate line.  The output will be narrower but
obviously much longer.
