How to select all records from one table that do not exist in another table?
SELECT t1.name
FROM table1 t1
LEFT JOIN table2 t2 ON t2.name = t1.name
WHERE t2.name IS NULL
Q: What is happening here?
A: Conceptually, we select all rows from table1 and for each row
   we attempt to find a row in table2 with the same value for the
   name column. If there is no such row, we just leave the table2
   portion of our result empty for that row. Then we constrain
   our selection by picking only those rows in the result where
   the matching row does not exist. Finally, We ignore all fields
   from our result except for the name column (the one we are sure
  that exists, from table1).

While it may not be the most performant method possible in all
cases, it should work in basically every database engine ever
that attempts to implement ANSI 92 SQL

MySql Select, MANY FIELDS, how best to display in terminal?
Try enabling vertical mode, using \G to execute the query instead of ;:
  mysql> SELECT * FROM sometable \G
Your results will be listed in the vertical mode, so each column value
will be printed on a separate line.  The output will be narrower but
obviously much longer.
