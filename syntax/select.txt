Select


Get all distinct idJobs values for all jobs:
  select distinct idJob from filexfer.jobs;

Get count of all distinct jobs:
  select count(distinct idJob) from filexfer.jobs;
  894

Select all jobs that have a monitor row configured:
  select jobs.idJob from filexfer2.jobs, filexfer2.monitors
  where filexfer2.jobs.idJob=filexfer2.monitors.idJob;

Get count of distinct jobs that  have a monitoring row configured:
  select count(distinct jobs.idJob) from filexfer2.jobs, filexfer2.monitors
  where filexfer2.jobs.idJob=filexfer2.monitors.idJob;
  192

Select all jobs that *do not* have a monitoring row configured:
  select distinct jobs.idJob from filexfer2.jobs, filexfer2.monitors
  where filexfer2.jobs.idJob!=filexfer2.monitors.idJob;

Get count of disinct jobs that *do not* have a monitoring row configured:
  select count(distinct jobs.idJob) from filexfer2.jobs, filexfer2.monitors
  where filexfer2.jobs.idJob!=filexfer2.monitors.idJob;
  549

192 + 549 = 741 (short 894 - 741 = 153 jobs)
