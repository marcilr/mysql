It should be noted that this does not create the new Database.
You first need to create the new Database (in this example
'yourSecondDatabase' ) and then run the above commands.

In case you use phpMyAdmin
1. Select the database you wish to copy (by clicking on the database from the
   phpMyAdmin home screen).
2. Once inside the database, select the Operations tab.
3. Scroll down to the section where it says "Copy database to:"
4. Type in the name of the new database.
5. Select "structure and data" to copy everything.
6. Check the box "CREATE DATABASE before copying" to create a new database.
7. Check the box "Add AUTO_INCREMENT value."
8. Click on the Go button to proceed.
