MySQL GUI Tools
So far I've tried MySQL Workbench, which never seemed to work properly,
phpMyAdmin which I found a bit slow, and Navicat which is a windows port
and runs under wine, but none of these is perfect.  In an ideal world,
I'm looking for something like a native version of navicat.

upgrade to the Oracle-controlled database â€” but Facebook and Twitter are also

As long as MariaDB is requiring copyright assignment [mariadb.com], there's
every reason to believe it will be sold off again the same way MySQL was.
The FSF gets away with that for GNU projects because they've never abused
contributor trust before.  Monty is no FSF, and there's no reason believe
MariaDB will remain outside of commercial control any better than MySQL did.
I can't believe people are falling for the same trick again."
