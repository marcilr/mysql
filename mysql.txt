MySQL (pron.: "My S-Q-L",[4] officially, but also called "My Sequel") is (as
of 2008) the world's most used[5][6] open source relational database
management system (RDBMS)[7] that runs as a server providing multi-user access
to a number of databases.

It is named after co-founder Michael Widenius' daughter, My.[8]  The SQL
phrase stands for Structured Query Language.[4]

The MySQL development project has made its source code available under the
terms of the GNU General Public License, as well as under a variety of
proprietary agreements.  MySQL was owned and sponsored by a single for-profit
firm, the Swedish company MySQL AB, now owned by Oracle Corporation.[9]

=============================
So far I've tried MySQL Workbench, which never seemed to work properly, phpMyAdmin
which I found a bit slow, and Navicat which is a windows port and runs under wine,
but none of these is perfect.  In an ideal world, I'm looking for something like a
native version of navicat.[1]
