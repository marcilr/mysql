MySQL Group Replication is Oracle's new multimaster, update-everywhere replication solution that
helps keep your MySQL databases highly available and your business up and running, without fail.
It's a MySQL plugin that combines distributed systems technologies with database replication into
a highly resilient HA solution.  At its core is a group communication service providing reliable
message passing among a group of MySQL servers. This enables automatic and consistent
coordination among all the participants in a group.  Such automatic orchestration of MySQL
servers results in a fault-tolerant replicated state machine providing a highly available MySQL
data store.

Join Group Replication Architect, Luis Soares, in this technical webinar to get the details behind
MySQL Group Replication, as well as practical advice on how to set it up, maintain it and power
your business with it.
