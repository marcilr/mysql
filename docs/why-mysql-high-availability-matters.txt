Why MySQL High Availability Matters

Matt Lord
MySQL Senior Product Manager
Oracle

MySQL high availability matters because your data matters.
If your database goes down, whether due to human error, catastrophic network
failure, or planned maintenance, the accessibility and accuracy of your data
can be compromised with disastrous results. Join Matt Lord, MySQLâ€™s High
Availability Product Manager as he examines the critical elements of a high
availability solution, including:
o Data redundancy
o Data consistency
o Automatic fault detection and resolution
o No single point of failure
  and how you can achieve them more easily than ever before using MySQL's new
  native HA solution.



o MySQL Group Library for MySQL 5.7 or later
  - Highly available distributed MySQL database service.
  - Do rolling maintenance operations.
  - Sharding is a type of database partitioning that separates very large databases
    the into smaller, faster, more easily managed parts called data shards.  The word
    shard means a small part of a whole.

  - Alternatice to master/slave replication
  - Better performance than similar offerings
  - Easy monitoring
  - Baked in part of MySQL
  - Available on all platforms
  - Does have some performance impact.  Relatively minor.
  - 3, 5, 7 machines per group.  Odd number to reach concensus on decisions.
  - Beefy machines: 32-64 vCPUs, fast CPU 2.5GHz+, SSDs
  - MySQL Group Replication
  - Sharded MySQL Group Replication clusters (working on it)
  - Looks sweet

 
Found in GCI NIT workstation the bottom front jacks do not work.
The center jack on the mobo audio parts works fine.

Checked out:
  alsamixer - shows sound enabled:
   Card: PulseAudio
   Chip: PulseAudio
   View: F3:[Playback] F4: Capture  F5: All
   Item: Master

   Shows: alsa 3.16

  Looks good.
