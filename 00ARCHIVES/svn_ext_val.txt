# phpmyadmin/             Web-based database administration tool. 
#                         phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in PHP,
#                         intended to handle the administration of MySQL over
#                         the Web.  phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of
#                         operations on MySQL, MariaDB and Drizzle.  Frequently
#                         used operations (managing databases, tables, columns,
#                         relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc) can be
#                         performed via the user interface, while you still
#                         have the ability to directly execute any SQL
#                         statement.  Installed since I read it has a nice
#                         database search feature.  However, not operation as
#                         I discovered that phpmyadmin requires it's own
#                         database.
